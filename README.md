# AUTOMATE RENDER SERVICE

Automate your render services so that you can suspend and resume services without waking up from your sleep.

## How it works

On your render dashboard, locate the service name and supply it within the `main` function [Comment left for direction]. That's it.

## Response

**'Service suspended!'**: Your service has been suspended.

**'Service resumed!'**: Your service has been resumed.
