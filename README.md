# AUTOMATE RENDER SERVICE

Automate your render services so that you can suspend and resume services without waking up from your sleep.

## How it works

1. On your render dashboard, locate the service name and supply it within the `main` function [Comment left for direction].

2. To install dependencies run `npm install`

3. To run script `npm start`

Automate with your favourite runner. [cron job, cronofy, etc.]

That's it.

## Response

**'Service suspended!'**: Your service has been suspended.

**'Service resumed!'**: Your service has been resumed.
